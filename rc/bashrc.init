## This is the first file you want to source.
## It sets up the environment for everything else.

## This bashrc behaves differently, based on the existance of 
## certain files in the home directory.
##       ~/.hushlogin             don't print anything
##       ~/.bashrc_time           output how long it takes to start up
##       ~/.bashrc_verbose        output how long each included item takes to load up
##       ~/.bashrc_skip           skip the includes
##       ~/.bashrc_mem            load stuff into a ramdisk
##       ~/.bashrc_email          show most recent emails (each line in this file corresponds to a section in ~/.mre.config)
##       ~/.bashrc_sfwfortunes    display only arxiv papers as fortunes
##             ( curl -L https://raw.github.com/swirepe/arXiv-fortunes/master/getShort.sh | bash )
